# kiro-recall: Implementation Plan

Full sequenced task list for building kiro-recall. Tasks marked `*` are optional and can be skipped for a faster MVP. Each task references specific requirements for traceability.

Spec references:
- **spec 01** = relevance detection and cold vault handling
- **spec 02** = session hook wiring and manual capture

---

## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Wire MCP server and vault path configuration
  - Register mcp-obsidian (smithery-ai/mcp-obsidian) as the MCP dependency in the Power manifest
  - Expose `vault_path` as a required user-configurable setting (absolute filesystem path to the vault root)
  - Validate that `vault_path` resolves to an accessible directory at startup; surface no error if it does not — failure handling is covered in task 7
  - All subsequent tasks depend on this wiring being in place
  - _Requirements: spec 02 — Req 1.1, Req 4.1, Req 4.2_

- [ ] 2. Implement Relevance Detector — generic name list and primary signal
  - [ ] 2.1 Define the Generic Name list as a documented constant
    - Include at minimum: `src`, `dev`, `project`, `app`, `code`, `workspace`, `repo`, `main`, `test`, `build`, `website`, `frontend`, `backend`, `api`, `server`, `client`, `lib`, `library`, `core`, `base`
    - _Requirements: spec 01 — Req 2.3_
  - [ ] 2.2 Implement Workspace Name extraction
    - Extract the final path segment from the current workspace root path
    - _Requirements: spec 01 — Req 1.1_
  - [ ] 2.3 Implement Primary Signal matching
    - If Workspace Name is not a Generic Name, search `01-projects/` for a case-insensitive name match (file or subfolder)
    - On match: load Project Note + all Permanent Notes; record source as `primary`
    - _Requirements: spec 01 — Req 1.2, Req 1.3, Req 1.4_
  - [ ]* 2.4 Write property test for Primary Signal matching
    - Property: Generic names never produce a primary match
    - Validates: spec 01 — Req 2.1, Req 2.2
  - [ ]* 2.5 Write unit tests for Workspace Name extraction and Primary Signal
    - Test case-insensitive matching
    - Test generic name bypass
    - _Requirements: spec 01 — Req 1.1, Req 1.2, Req 2.1_

- [ ] 3. Implement Relevance Detector — secondary signal
  - [ ] 3.1 Implement open-file path scanning
    - Inspect paths of all files currently open in the workspace
    - Match any path segment case-insensitively against subfolder names in `01-projects/`; use the first match as the resolved project identifier
    - _Requirements: spec 01 — Req 3.1, Req 3.2_
  - [ ] 3.2 Implement `.kiro/steering` project field fallback
    - If no open-file match found, read `.kiro/steering` and use the `project` field value as a candidate identifier if it matches a name in `01-projects/`
    - _Requirements: spec 01 — Req 3.3_
  - [ ] 3.3 On secondary match: load Project Note + all Permanent Notes; record source as `secondary`
    - _Requirements: spec 01 — Req 3.4, Req 3.5_
  - [ ]* 3.4 Write unit tests for secondary signal
    - Test open-file path match takes precedence over steering field
    - Test steering field used when no open-file match
    - _Requirements: spec 01 — Req 3.1, Req 3.2, Req 3.3_

- [ ] 4. Implement Relevance Detector — fallback and decision tree
  - [ ] 4.1 Implement fallback path
    - When neither primary nor secondary resolves a project, load all Permanent Notes from `06-permanent/`; record source as `fallback`
    - _Requirements: spec 01 — Req 4.1, Req 4.2_
  - [ ] 4.2 Wire the full decision tree
    - Implement the ordered evaluation: generic check → primary → secondary → fallback, stopping at the first branch that produces a result
    - _Requirements: spec 01 — Req 5.1, Req 5.2_
  - [ ]* 4.3 Write property test for decision tree ordering
    - Property: A higher-priority signal match always prevents lower-priority evaluation
    - Validates: spec 01 — Req 5.2
  - [ ]* 4.4 Write unit tests for fallback path
    - Test fallback fires only when primary and secondary both fail
    - _Requirements: spec 01 — Req 4.1, Req 4.2_

- [ ] 5. Checkpoint — Relevance Detector complete
  - Ensure all Relevance Detector tests pass. Ask the user if questions arise.

- [ ] 6. Implement cold vault detection and UX message
  - [ ] 6.1 Implement Cold Vault check
    - A vault is Cold Vault when `06-permanent/` contains zero markdown files AND `00-inbox/` contains zero markdown files
    - _Requirements: spec 01 — Req 6.1_
  - [ ] 6.2 Wire cold vault path into the decision tree
    - When fallback path reaches an empty `06-permanent/`, treat as Cold Vault: skip Context Injection, display no error
    - _Requirements: spec 01 — Req 6.2, Req 6.3_
  - [ ] 6.3 Display cold vault UX message verbatim
    - Show exactly:
      > Your vault is empty — no context loaded yet. That's fine, you're just getting started. Use `/recall` during this session to capture your first note. It'll land in your inbox and kiro-recall will confirm it worked.
    - `/recall` must be rendered as a highlighted, actionable reference
    - No additional diagnostic output, stack traces, or file paths
    - _Requirements: spec 01 — Req 7.1, Req 7.2, Req 7.3_
  - [ ]* 6.4 Write unit tests for cold vault detection
    - Test both conditions required (permanent empty AND inbox empty)
    - Test that a non-empty inbox alone prevents cold vault classification
    - _Requirements: spec 01 — Req 6.1_

    - When Match Source is `fallback`: `Loaded {N} permanent notes (fallback — no project match found).`
    - When zero Permanent Notes alongside a Project Note: omit `+ 0 permanent notes`
    - Warm, conversational tone; no file paths, internal identifiers, or diagnostic output
    - _Requirements: spec 02 — Req 3.1, Req 3.2, Req 3.3, Req 3.4, Req 3.5, Req 3.6_
  - [ ] 8.2 Surface Session Summary to the user after Context Injection completes
    - _Requirements: spec 02 — Req 2.3_

    - _Requirements: spec 02 — Req 4.1, Req 4.3, Req 4.4_
  - [ ] 9.2 Detect unavailable MCP server at session start

  - [ ] 13.2 Implement first-capture confirmation
    - When `00-inbox/` contained zero markdown files before this write, display instead:
      > Note saved to your inbox. Your vault is live — next session, kiro-recall will load context automatically.
    - When `00-inbox/` already contains one or more files, display the standard confirmation only

## Notes

- Tasks marked `*` are optional and can be skipped for a faster MVP
- Each task references specific requirements and acceptance criteria for traceability
- Checkpoints at tasks 5, 10, and 15 provide incremental validation gates
- The MCP server (task 1) is a hard dependency for all subsequent tasks
- Cold vault and first-capture paths share state about inbox contents — implement the inbox check once and reuse it in tasks 6 and 13
